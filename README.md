# FooDock
A handy floating window (a dock) for foobar2000 - result of my efforts from 2008-2010

Read more about this project on my blog - https://www.namekdev.net/apps/foodock/ - **Download** section is available.

# The status

Component should work with foobar2000 1.3.x, it works for sure with 1.3.7.

I do NOT maintain it anymore.


# Short history

I created this component back in 2008 (year before starting studying on university), then it was developed until 2010 at max. Thus, I don't know what these files are all about or even whether all of that compiles (however, I think it does).

I can see that I tried using [Bazaar SCM](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/) but I just ignored it by pushing it here on GitHub.

You can find a big [TODO](TODO.txt) list (lang: PL). Some files are questionable.

# Contents

[There](foobar2000-SDK.rar) is also compressed [foobar2000 SDK](http://www.foobar2000.org/SDK) - probably not the latest version.
